# **Project  - whether or not itâ€™s beneficial for Eniac to discount products.?**

Hello everyone, I would like to present my work for **${\color{green}Project 1}$**, where my team and I analyzed the data provided by Eniac. 

Our task was to determine whether heavy discounting of products is beneficial for the company. To support our recommendation, we conducted thorough data research.

First, we cleaned the database to eliminate corrupted or duplicated data, ensure proper data types, and retain only relevant information to address the business questions. 
We categorized the products using our determined classifications and color-coded these categories to highlight the most popular and highest revenue-generating products in 2017.

Additionally, we analyzed sales performance during special events such as Black Friday and Christmas, and assessed their contributions to the annual revenue. 
Through this comprehensive analysis, we provided data-driven insights to guide Eniac's discounting strategy.

## How did we obtain and present the data?
To achieve this, we explored the data using **pandas** libraries for data manipulation and **Seaborn** for visualization.
